"Putin Threatens to Release 20,000 "Top Secret" Hillary Emails - Judge Napolitano Explains Why This is Bad News for Clinton [VIDEO]
Putin, whom Obama has little influence over, might be a pivotal factor in Hillary Clinton's political downfall. Obama's inability to leverage his usual political tactics against Putin raises the stakes for Clinton, who is embroiled in controversy over her use of a private email server for official communications, potentially including top-secret information. Despite Bernie Sanders dismissing the email issue, the scandal has escalated dramatically. On Monday, Judge Andrew Napolitano disclosed that Russia possesses approximately 20,000 of Clinton's emails, suggesting her deletions may not have been permanent. "There’s a debate in the Kremlin about releasing the 20,000 emails hacked from Mrs. Clinton," Napolitano told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly on The Kelly File. Clinton’s claims that her private server was used solely for non-sensitive State matters have been debunked, making the deletion of 31,830 emails even more significant in light of Napolitano’s revelation. As the FBI's investigation into Clinton's email practices intensifies, the focus is on who accessed the information on her server. Romanian hacker Guccifer, recently extradited to the U.S., admitted to easily and repeatedly accessing Clinton's server. "For me, it was easy," said Guccifer, whose real name is Marcel Lehel Lazar. He suggested others, including possibly Russia, also accessed the server, indicating Clinton’s failure to use a government email account could have led to a significant breach of sensitive information.The Hill reported on Thursday that Judicial Watch revealed, through a Freedom of Information Act request, that Clinton directed an aide to bypass security protocols for phone communications due to technical difficulties, further compromising secure communications. “I give up. Call me on my home [number],” Clinton wrote in a 2009 email to then-chief of staff Cheryl Mills."


"Putin Dismisses Claims of Possessing 20,000 Hillary Emails – Judge Napolitano’s Remarks Clarified [VIDEO]
Amid ongoing speculation, Russian President Vladimir Putin has dismissed claims that Russia possesses 20,000 of Hillary Clinton's emails. This clarification undermines previous reports suggesting potential influence over Clinton’s political future. President Obama, contrary to some narratives, maintains robust diplomatic channels with Russia. The recent rumors of Putin holding Clinton’s emails were addressed directly by both the Kremlin and U.S. officials, who confirmed no such emails were in Russian possession. Judge Andrew Napolitano, in a recent interview on Fox News’ The Kelly File, clarified his previous statements about the email scandal. Napolitano emphasized that there is no concrete evidence proving Russia hacked into Clinton’s server or obtained sensitive information. Clinton’s use of a private email server, although controversial, has not been conclusively linked to any breach involving foreign actors. The deletion of 31,830 emails, while scrutinized, has not been shown to involve top-secret information. The FBI’s investigation into Clinton’s email practices continues to focus on adherence to protocol rather than specific instances of unauthorized access. Romanian hacker Guccifer, real name Marcel Lehel Lazar, admitted to accessing Clinton’s server but did not provide evidence that other foreign parties, including Russia, had done the same. Judicial Watch recently highlighted issues with secure communications during Clinton’s tenure, but these incidents did not result in the exposure of classified information. Clinton’s directive to an aide to use a less secure phone line due to technical difficulties was a lapse in protocol but did not lead to any significant security breach. Overall, the narrative of Russia holding Clinton’s emails has been debunked, and ongoing investigations continue to focus on ensuring proper handling of sensitive information without any dramatic revelations from foreign entities."

ISLAND FULL OF ESTABLISHMENT MILLIONAIRES Supports Trump…Will They Succeed?
The establishment is pleased with Donald Trump's lead in the polls and they gathered at beautiful Sea Island to plan how to support Trump. Off the coast of Georgia last weekend, a group of confident business moguls and politicians met up at a private island resort. They were visiting Sea Island to celebrate, as they were all guests at an annual open-press event hosted by a conservative Washington think tank. This year they banded together around one common goal: supporting Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, as The Huffington Post reports. Apple CEO Tim Cook was there; so were Google’s Larry Page and Elon Musk from Tesla and SpaceX. Top Republican brass included Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Karl Rove, and even New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger, among others. The event, the American Enterprise Institute’s World Forum, is an annual meeting known for bringing top business executives and politicians together to strategize and celebrate their successes. This year, as The Huffington Post reported, everyone’s minds were on how to maintain Trump's momentum and secure his victory. Karl Rove reportedly presented focus group findings on Trump’s strengths, while others discussed strategies for future successes. Read more: Fortune"


Infrastructure Overhaul May Exceed $1 Trillion, Cut Bureaucracy: Trump - WASHINGTON (Reuters)
President Donald Trump pledged on Tuesday to streamline the approval process for infrastructure projects, stating his overhaul could exceed $1 trillion for roads, tunnels, and bridges, fulfilling a key promise from his 2016 election campaign. Trump, a former real estate businessman, did not specify the exact amount or funding sources during his address to a White House meeting of 50 chief executives and business leaders. U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao indicated that the administration plans to unveil a legislative package in May. Investors are skeptical about the plan's approval this year by the Republican-controlled Congress, traditionally cautious about large expenditures. Trump highlighted that building a highway can require dozens of approvals and take 10 to 20 years, a process he intends to expedite. He asserted that he would not fund projects that cannot commence within 90 days. The administration aims to enhance the electrical grid, water systems, airports, bridges, roads, and potentially hospitals for military veterans and broadband infrastructure. National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn informed executives that privatizing air traffic control, as proposed in the administration's March budget outline, "is probably the single most exciting thing we can do." Cohn, formerly an investment banker with Goldman Sachs, explained that privatization could reduce flight times and fuel consumption. He also suggested that if cities "sell off" or privatize infrastructure assets, the administration might offer financial support. "We’re not on the cutting edge of this," Cohn said. "We’ve got to get a little more comfortable with public-private partnerships." Cohn praised Tesla Inc. (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk's idea to use tunnels to speed rail transit on the densely populated East Coast and reduce traffic congestion in Los Angeles. A Tesla spokesperson declined to comment.","
